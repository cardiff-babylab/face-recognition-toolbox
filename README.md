# TinyExplorer Face Recognition Toolbox
## Overview
The TinyExplorer Face Recognition Toolbox is a user-friendly graphical interface designed specifically for developmental psychologists working with infants and young children. This toolbox integrates state-of-the-art open-source face recognition algorithms into an easy-to-use software package, streamlining the process of analyzing facial data in developmental research.
## Features
- Simple graphical user interface for easy operation
- Integration of cutting-edge face recognition models
- Batch processing capabilities for efficient analysis of large datasets
- Customizable confidence thresholds for detection accuracy
## Face Recognition Models
The toolbox currently supports two powerful face recognition models:
- YOLOv8: A real-time object detection system that can identify and locate faces in images with high accuracy. YOLOv8 is known for its speed and precision, making it ideal for processing large volumes of data.
- RetinaFace: A robust face detection model that excels in identifying faces in various poses, scales, and lighting conditions. RetinaFace is particularly useful for detecting faces in challenging environments or when dealing with diverse participant demographics.
## Value for Developmental Psychologists
This toolbox addresses several key needs in developmental psychology research:
Efficiency: Automates the time-consuming process of manual face detection in video and image data.
Accessibility: Provides a user-friendly interface, making advanced face recognition technology accessible to researchers without extensive programming experience.
Flexibility: Allows researchers to easily switch between different face recognition models to suit their specific research needs.
Reproducibility: Ensures consistent application of face detection criteria across studies, enhancing research reproducibility.
## Development and Contributions
This toolbox is actively developed by the Cardiff University BabyLab, a research group dedicated to exploring attentional and motor skills in young children and their impact on learning in everyday settings. We welcome contributions from the developmental psychology community to enhance and expand the capabilities of this toolbox.
